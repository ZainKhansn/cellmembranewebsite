          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In general,{" "}
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            <strong>lipids</strong>
          </span>{" "}
          are water-insoluble compounds that serve as fuel stores and signaling
          molecules. Lipids are also the main structural component of biological
          membranes. We will be focusing on the latter function.
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are three classes of membrane
          lipids:&nbsp;
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            <strong>phospholipids</strong>
          </span>
          ,{" "}
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            <strong>glycolipids</strong>
          </span>
          , and{" "}
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            <strong>cholesterol</strong>
          </span>
          . All three of these lipid classes possess the special quality of
          being{" "}
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            <strong>amphipathic</strong>
          </span>
          . That is, one portion of the lipid is{" "}
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            <strong>h</strong>
            <strong>ydrophilic</strong>
          </span>
          , "water loving", and the rest is{" "}
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            <strong>hydrophobic</strong>
          </span>
          , "water-fearing". The amphipathic nature of lipids is of key
          importance to the structure of membrane bilayers, as we will discuss
          shortly.
