                &emsp;&emsp; In general, lipids are water-insoluble compounds that serve as fuel stores and signaling molecules.
                Lipids are also the main structural component of biological membranes. We will be focusing on the 
                latter function. <br></br><br></br>&emsp;&emsp;There are three classes of membrane lipids: phospholipids, glycolipids, and cholesterol.
                All three of these lipid classes possess the special quality of being amphipathic. That is, one portion of
                the lipid is hydrophilic, "water- loving", and the rest is hydrophobic, "water- fearing". The amphipathic
                nature of lipids is of key importance to the structure of membrane bilayers, as we will discuss shortly.
