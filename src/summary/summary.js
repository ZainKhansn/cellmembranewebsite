        Biological membranes are sheet-like structures composed mainly of lipids
        and proteins. All biological membranes have a similar general structure,
        Membrane lipids are organized in a bilayer (two sheets of lipids making
        up a single membrane) that is approximately 60 to 100 A thick. The
        proteins, on the other hand, are scattered throughout the bilayer and
        perform most membrane functions. Membranes are two-dimensional fluids:
        both lipids and proteins are constantly in motion. The fluid-mosaic
        model encompasses our current understanding of membrane structure. It
        describes both the "mosaic" arrangement of proteins embedded throughout
        the lipid bilayer as well as the “fluid” movement of lipids and proteins
        alike. You will learn about the details of this model as you proceed
        through the tutorial.
