      <h>Where are Membranes Found?</h>
      <p>
        While all cells are surrounded by a
        <strong>
          <u>plasma membrane</u>
        </strong>
        , eukaryotic cells possess additional internal membranes that surround
        organelles like the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi
        apparatus, mitochondria, and lysosomes. The plasma membrane keeps a cell
        intact by holding all of the cellular components inside. It also keeps
        many unwanted molecules outside of the cell. Internal membranes are
        crucial for creating micro-environments containing sequestered enzymes
        or high concentrations of hydrogen ions (low pH). Five general
        categories of membrane function are illustrated in the next section.{" "}
